ASCII-style Roguelike written in Python3

This project has started as a direct clone of TStrand90's Python + libtcod Roguelike Tutorial (https://github.com/TStand90/roguelike_tutorial_revised)

This is a learning project; through many modifications, after many frustrations, and gallons of booze, this might actually become a decently playable game...

Or maybe not, who knows?  But at least I'll have learned things!

More updates to come as the project evolves.
